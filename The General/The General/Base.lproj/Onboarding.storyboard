The General® Account Alerts
Text Messages. The General® Account Alerts Program - With your prior consent to opt-in for text messages regarding your policy, we will send text messages to your mobile device. The frequency of the messages will depend on your account activity. We do not charge for this service but message and data rates may apply from your carrier. You can log into MyPolicy to change your profile settings. To stop receiving text messages from us, text STOP to 737373. If you elect to stop receiving text messages, you will receive a final text confirming that your number has been unsubscribed. For help, text HELP to 737373 or call support at 1-800-280-1466.

- At this time, we cannot accept questions or policy changes via text; those should continue to be handled by accessing your MyPolicy account or by contacting us at 1-800-280-1466.

- Alerts sent via SMS (texting service) may not be delivered to you if your phone is not in range of a transmission site, or if sufficient network capacity is not available at a particular time. Even within a coverage area, factors beyond the control of your wireless carrier may interfere with message delivery, including the customer's equipment, terrain, proximity to buildings, foliage, and weather. You acknowledge that urgent alerts may not be received timely and that your wireless carrier does not guarantee that alerts will be delivered. Likewise, The General® cannot guarantee timeliness or delivery and we are not liable for losses or damages arising from non-delivery, delayed delivery, or misdirected delivery of a text message.

- Text messages to The General® can never be used to contact 911 or other emergency services.

- SMS text message notifications may be delayed or not received during regional emergencies or other periods of high messaging traffic.

- Third parties can send SMS text messages disguised as alerts from The General® and therefore you are urged to verify independently the authenticity of any message that you receive.

- SMS text message notifications from The General® will be presented on your mobile device in the same manner as any other SMS text messages. You accept that each text message may not be encrypted, and may contain information about your policy.

- The General® will send text messages using automated technology. If your mobile number is disconnected or transferred to a different mobile carrier, you must complete the consent process at The General® for your new mobile phone number.

- The General® is working with AT&amp;T, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile®, Metro PCS, Sprint, Boost, Virgin Mobile, U.S. Cellular®, and others. Customers who use a different carrier should contact their mobile carrier to determine if this service is available and the cost associated with texting.

- The mobile carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

- Because many phone companies recycle phone numbers, it is possible for customers who purchase a new phone to receive messages that the previous owner had subscribed to or otherwise consented to receive. The General® will periodically purge phone numbers that have been reassigned or discontinued after being notified by the phone companies of discontinued/recycled phone numbers.

- Customers are not required to provide consent to receive text messages as a condition of purchasing any goods or services.

- By consenting to receive text messages from The General®, the customer is stating that they are over the age of 13 years and that they wish to receive text communications from The General®. Consent can be given via email, web site form, text message, telephone key press or voice recording.

- We reserve the right to terminate this text messaging service, in whole or in part, at any time without notice.

Permanent General Privacy Policy – Information Practices
Please read this notice to learn how your information may be used by us and about your right to review and correct personal data. Our goal is to protect the confidentiality of information that you provide to us. By providing any information through our site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

Your privacy is important to us. Permanent General protects the confidentiality of personal information that you provide to us or we collect. We have physical, electronic, and procedural security in place to protect personal data. We may collect personal information, such as consumer reports that include credit information (where permitted by law) and reports about you, your vehicles and the drivers in your household with respect to your application for insurance, renewals, changes to your policy, and claims. Insurance scoring information including credit, where allowed by law, may be used to determine your premium for insurance. We may use a third party to get this score. Any nonpublic personal information we have about you or listed drivers is confidential information and kept private. However, the personal information collected, may, if permitted by law, be disclosed without prior authorization to non-affiliated third parties. We may also share information with affiliated companies for such purposes as claims handling, servicing, underwriting, pricing and insurance marketing. Information may be provided to others when required by law to or pursuant to legal process.

Types of Information We Collect and Disclose. We collect non-public personal financial and health information about you, your family and your property in order to issue and service policies, and handle claims. Non-public personal financial and health information is defined as information not generally available to the public. We collect this information in a number of ways, including:

- E-mail. We may email requests to you to complete and support your transactions with us and to comply with law. We may also send you email to follow-up on coverage quotes, respond to your questions, and to provide you with information about your policy and other information. We will not share your email address with third parties without your consent.

- Information that you give us when you apply for a policy or make a policy change. When you apply for a policy we record the information that you give us on an application form. We also record information when you request a policy change. The information we obtain may include your name, address, and telephone number, driver’s license number, social security number, date of birth, length of employment, gender, marital status, prior insurance information, home ownership, length of residency, vehicle descriptions, miles driven and vehicle use, other drivers, vehicle garaging address and driving history.

- Information that we acquire in the course of doing business with you. We collect information about your transactions with our company and other companies. It may include your insurance coverage selections and premiums, payment and claims history, information used to calculate premium, and your payment and billing information. It may also include information used to adjust, investigate, settle, and defend claims, such as witness statements, and police reports.

- Information that we acquire from third parties. We collect information from consumer reporting agencies. It may include motor vehicle and driving records, accident and claims history reports, insurance records, and consumer reports that may include credit information. Upon your written request to us, we will provide you with a copy of this information and the provider of such information. You have the right to review this information and ask for correction of any erroneous information found in the records of these third parties.

- Information that we acquire from our Web site. Our website is encrypted to protect your information. We create “cookies” (a small text file stored on your computer) while you are on our Web site. The “cookie” does not contain any personal information. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. In addition, tracking technology including, but not limited to, cookies, beacons, tags and scripts or other similar technologies may be utilized by Permanent General and analytic service providers (e.g. Google Analytics). These tracking technologies are used to gather information about our user base. The information collected may include device specific-information (including, but not limited to, hardware model, operating system version and unique device identifiers) and unique application numbers if included within the respective service. We may receive reports on this demographic information from analytic service providers to understand specific market segments based on the demographic and interest data received. This information will be used for, but not limited to, Remarketing, Display Network Impression Reporting, and Demographics and Interest Reporting. The use of these tracking features is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy, as amended by Google. You may opt-out of this data collection by installing the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on and Google Ad Removal Plugin.

Parties to Whom We Disclose Information. We do not sell information to third parties for marketing or any purposes without your consent. We may disclose your information without authorization to affiliated and non-affiliated third parties as permitted by law and for our everyday business purposes, such as to process insurance transactions, maintain a policy, respond to court orders and legal investigations, and reports to credit bureaus. This may include disclosure to agents, insurance regulators, actuarial studies, law enforcement and affiliates. Information obtained from a report prepared by an insurance-support organization may be retained by the insurance-support organization and disclosed to other persons. All third parties are subject to agreements to maintain the confidentiality of your nonpublic personal information. When you are no longer our policyholder, we continue to share your information as described in this notice.

Confidentiality &amp; Security. We restrict access to non-public personal information about you to our employees and other parties who must use that information to provide products or services to you. Their right to disclose or use the information is limited by our employee code of conduct, applicable law, and nondisclosure agreements where appropriate. We also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or use.

Your Right To Review and Correct Personal Data. Upon your written request, and pursuant to law, you may review your information in our records. If you see any inaccuracies in your information you can send us a written statement describing the information you believe is incorrect and information that should appear in its place. We will either make the requested correction or tell you why we will not or cannot make the correction. If we correct your records, we will send confirmation to you and send the corrected information to any insurance support organizations we provided with your information. We will also furnish the corrected information to any person you designate who may have received the information within the last 2 years. We cannot correct Consumer Report Information, such as a credit report. To do this, you must contact the consumer reporting agency that provided it. If we refuse to make a requested correction, you may file a written statement with us describing the information you believe is incorrect, and information that should appear in its place. Your statement will become part of your file. It will be sent to the same persons to whom we would send a copy of any correction or change. Additionally, your statement will be included in any subsequent, lawful disclosure.

Include your name, address, policy number, and a description of the data you would like to review. We may charge a reasonable fee.
