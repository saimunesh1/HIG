DISCUSSION:

In order to account for variables which will get switched out in code, we'll use symbols surrounded by '|'s.
 
For example: |noun| will get switched out at runtime for a customized phrase. During language translation, words inside of '|'s should be IGNORED. Or, the type of word can be inferred by the language translation system to indicate where to place the word.

"contextualhelp.comprehensive" = "Q: What's the difference between Comprehensive and Other than Collision coverage?\n\nA: Other than Collision coverage is optional, however it must be included when collision coverage is selected. The deductible amount you see in your quote refers to the portion of the claim that you are responsible for. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium. \n\nThis coverage pays expenses for damage to your vehicle not caused by collision that exceed the deductible that you select. You will be required to pay your deductible if your vehicle sustains damages that fall under this coverage. If your vehicle is totaled and the damages fall under Other than Collision Coverage, you will be reimbursed for the Actual Cash Value (ACV) of your vehicle, less your deductible. The actual cash value of your vehicle is its true market value. This is determined by the year, make, model and condition of your vehicle. \n\nWhat is covered? \nOther than Collision Coverage covers damages to your vehicle that are not the result of your vehicle overturning or colliding with another object or vehicle. This includes loss to your vehicle from fire, theft, vandalism, hail, or contact with an animal. This coverage will only apply to vehicles listed on your policy for which you have selected an Other than Collision Coverage deductible. \n\nWhy do I need this? \nIf you have a bank loan on your vehicle or a leased vehicle, you are usually required to carry this coverage. You should also select this coverage to ensure less out of pocket expenses. \n\nExample \nYour car incurs hail damage during a storm. You will be required to pay the amount of your deductible, and the rest will be paid through Other than Collision Coverage. \nYour coverage limits, deductibles, and certain exclusions may apply.";
